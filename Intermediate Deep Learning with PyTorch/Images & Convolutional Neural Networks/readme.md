# Presentation

Train neural networks to solve image classification tasks. In this chapter, you will learn how to handle image data in PyTorch and get to grips with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). You will practice training and evaluating an image classifier while learning about how to improve the model performance with data augmentation.
