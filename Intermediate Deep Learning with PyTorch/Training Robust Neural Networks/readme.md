# Presentation:

Learn how to train neural networks in a robust way. In this chapter, you will use object-oriented programming to define PyTorch datasets and models and refresh your knowledge of training and evaluating neural networks. You will also get familiar with different optimizers and, finally, get to grips with various techniques that help mitigate the problems of unstable gradients so ubiquitous in neural nets training.
